NOTE : Core hasn't been committed yet. Check back soon.

binary compound file reader aims to fully implement the Compound File Binary file specifications in PHP to support reading and parsing of Microsoft Office documents (word, excel etc.) and eventually support a full translation into html rendered content and vice versa.

Check back soon for a working version.

  * Immediate goal is to implement CFB specifications fully and support the reading of Word documents that are in format version 3.
  * Short-term goals : Implement a framework to read all Office documents and implement a html formatting engine for parsed content.
  * Medium to long term goals : Implement a fully functional bi-directional reading/writing framework.
